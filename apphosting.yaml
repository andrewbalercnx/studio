  # Allow auto-scaling up to 5 instances under load
  # This prevents CPU/memory-heavy requests (AI flows, PDF generation)
  # from piling onto a single VM and causing crashes
  minInstances: 0
  maxInstances: 5

  # Resource limits for each instance
  # AI and PDF generation are CPU/memory intensive
  cpu: 2

  # Request timeout (5 minutes) for long-running operations
  # Note: Consider moving very long operations to Cloud Functions or Cloud Run Jobs
  timeoutSeconds: 300

  # Concurrency limit per instance
  # Lower value prevents memory exhaustion from parallel heavy requests
