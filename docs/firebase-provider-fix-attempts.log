Attempt #1: Incorrectly structured providers by creating app-layout.tsx and wrapping it. Failed.
Attempt #2: Moved provider logic inside app-layout.tsx. Failed.
Attempt #3: Removed app-layout.tsx and placed FirebaseClientProvider directly in RootLayout. Failed.
Attempt #4: Re-created providers.tsx but with incorrect component structure inside. Failed.
Attempt #5: (Current & Final) Implemented the canonical provider pattern. Created a dedicated 'src/app/providers.tsx' Client Component to house all client-side layout and context providers. The root 'src/app/layout.tsx' is now a pure Server Component that delegates its children to this new Providers component. This definitively separates server and client concerns.
