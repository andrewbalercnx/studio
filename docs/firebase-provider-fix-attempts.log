ATTEMPT 1: 
- Create src/app/providers.tsx as a client component.
- This provider will contain FirebaseClientProvider, Header, and Toaster.
- The RootLayout (server component) in src/app/layout.tsx will use this Providers component to wrap its children.
- This establishes a clean client boundary at the top of the application tree, ensuring context is available before any client components like Header need it. This is the canonical Next.js App Router pattern.
