# **App Name**: StoryPic Kids

## Core Features:

- Story Suggestion & Guidance: AI provides story suggestions and questions to guide the child in creating their unique story. LLM can act as a tool in deciding the order and context of these suggestions and questions.
- Character Upload & Transformation: Allow the child to upload photos of themselves, friends, and family, then transform them into characters matching a chosen art style, suitable for the book.
- Art Style Selection: A range of pre-designed image styles that can be selected to set the art direction.
- Page Layout & Book Creation: Automatically create a front cover, back cover (with child's name), and inside pages combining the child's story with generated images.
- Print-on-Demand API Integration: Integrate with a print-on-demand service via API to allow physical books to be created directly. (Details: Images will be turned into a front cover for a book, a back cover with their name on, and inside pages.  These will be sent by API to a print-on-demand service.)

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Cheerful purple (#A075EA) to capture the magical nature of the app. This balances childhood joy with sophistication.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E8E2F2), very slightly desaturated, complements the primary and is easy on the eyes for long use.
- Accent color: Sky blue (#75A0EA), contrasts well and adds a friendly tone.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' for headlines and body text; this font combines a modern look with approachability, which is perfectly aligned with the user stories this application generates.
- Use bright, playful icons related to storytelling and art, such as pencils, books, stars, and speech bubbles.
- The user interface will have clear visual hierarchy, with easily navigable sections to guide the child through story creation.
- Animations are employed to indicate active or changed items
